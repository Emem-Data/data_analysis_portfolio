## Portfolio Projects
A curated collection of my data analysis projects, highlighting practical applications and compelling insights.

### **1. Call-Center Analysis**

Imagine you're the manager of a busy call center for a large telecommunications company. Every day, your team receives hundreds of calls from customers with a variety of questions and issues. You're always looking for ways to improve the customer experience and increase efficiency, but you're not quite sure where to start.

That's where this analysis comes in. Over the course of a few nights â€“ Actually just twoðŸ˜‰ â€“ I delved into the call center dataset to uncover key insights and identify opportunities for improvement. I got the dataset from a #DataChallenge WhatsApp group and upon downloading the dataset, I wore my detective mask and began to check if I could identify patterns or trends in the data that would be worthy of investigation.

+ **Technology:** Microsoft Excel.

+ **Skills:** Explorative Data Analysis, Data Insights, Analytical Dashboard, Documentation and Reporting.


### **2. Messy Data Cleaning**

Technology is rapidly evolving and changing the way we work with data. One example of this is the emergence of advanced language models like ChatGPT, which can generate data for analytical purposes. In this project, I'll be showcasing my SQL skills by cleaning a dataset of 35 rows and 5 columns, which was generated by ChatGPT.

By leveraging cutting-edge technology, we can access larger and more diverse datasets than ever before, and use them to uncover new insights and trends.

+ **Technology:** ChatGPT, Microsoft Sql Server.

+ **Skills:** Data Cleaning and Transformation, Query Writing, Data Integrity and Validation, Documentation and Reporting.


### **3. PizzaSales Analysis**

Data Analysis: Analyze the company data to identify customers needs, behaviour patterns, and preferences.  We would also identify fast and slow-moving products which will help us reduce stock outs  and optimize warehouse operations. 

+ **View Code:** [PizzaSales_Analysis](https://github.com/Emem-Data/PizzaSales_Analysis)

+ **Technology:** Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint.

+ **Skills:** Data Analysis, Pivot tables and charts, Data Insights, Analytical Dashboard, Documentation and Reporting, Documentation and Reporting, Presentation.


### **4. FIFA'21 Data Cleaning** 
Football is the most popular sport in the world and FIFA is the organization responsible for organizing the most prestigious football tournament, the FIFA World Cup. In this project, we will explore the FIFA 2021 dataset, which contains detailed information on the players and teams featured in the game. The dataset provides a wealth of information on player attributes such as speed, agility, shooting accuracy, and more. However, like most real-world datasets, the FIFA 2021 dataset is far from perfect. Our goal in this project is to clean and prepare the dataset for further analysis and modelling. Through the data-cleaning process, we will discover patterns and insights that can inform future game development and player performance analysis. This project is a great opportunity to showcase the importance of data cleaning and preparation in data analysis, especially when dealing with large, complex datasets.

### **5. Olist Business Data Cleaning** 

In this documentation, we outline the meticulous process undertaken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data within the context of the Olist e-commerce business. Olist, a prominent Brazilian e-commerce platform, serves as a vital conduit linking small and medium-sized enterprises with customers throughout Brazil. The subsequent sections provide an insight into the rigorous cleaning procedures adopted to refine the data and guarantee its integrity, thereby fortifying the foundation upon which informed business decisions are predicated.

The dataset used for our analysis consists of data from orders placed between January 2017 and August 2018. It's divided into 9 tables, each holding different types of information. These tables include details about customers, locations, items ordered, payments made, customer reviews, orders, products, sellers, and translated product categories.

I chose Azure Data Studio as my editor for this task. After adding the SQL Server Import extension, I set up a new database and used the extension to bring in my data.

### **6. Bikestores Analysis**

In this project, I followed a tutorial from a YouTube channel to analyze data from a bike store. The process involved:

1. Data Loading and Cleaning: Using MySQL, I loaded and cleaned the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency.

2. Data Connection and Analysis: I connected the cleaned data to Excel for further analysis.

3. Dashboard Creation: Utilizing Excel's powerful features, I created an insightful dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends.
